## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
rm(list=ls()) # Clear memory
install.packages("sf")
```

Loading the necessary libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf) # The sf package provides functions for working with spatial data
```

Creating census block dataset
```{r}
census = read_sf("orange_durham_wake_block_groups.shp")
#NOTE: I had to put this document inside my hw3 data folder for it to run properly, and also open a new project as hw3 data
```

- This doesn't have any demographic information, so I need to read in a csv file that does 

Adding Census Demographic csv
```{r}
census_demographics = read.csv("triangle_census.csv")
```
